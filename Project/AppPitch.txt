My goal is to create a chat ai that allows user to search the web, perform mathematical equations, 
shows the date and time, and can even have conversations about different topics. These include topics like what happened 
in a previous football, basketball, baseball, or soccer game. It can even provide resources to different sites that can help you with anywork that you may need.

The chat ai program aims to solve problems like: someone wants to talk about particular topics, they want to gather information on academical
subjects(math, english, and/or history), and may need quick answers to problems. People are often unable have someone to talk to, find information correctly,
and get quick solutions for something simple. This is where the chat ai does its job to fulfill these things. 

The intended auidence for my app are students in school who need help with work for specifically those in high school or college where the curriculum tends to be
rigorous. This app can be used for anyone or anything such as research, conversations, and etc.
