#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user? The built-in function I would use is the
# print() function.

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program? I would use the input() function.

#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 

# Complexity is understanding the process of an outcome,
# like knowing what ingredients to make a game. While
# abstraction is the way of simplifying those steps.

#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error? 
# When you encounter a syntax error, it's telling you that you
# wrote something that the computer doesn't understand. This is usually
# when you write the a function the wrong way.

#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.
# A variable is a container for any unknown data that can vary. 
k = 'Kite' 

#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.

b = 'Braheem'
print(b)

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?
# A function definition allows the the computer to store instructions 
# and, a function call allows the instructions to be put in action.

#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal --> Allows for variables to connect to their value
# == // double equal --> Shows that two integers are equal
# != // exclaimation equal --> 

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2) # --> The output will give you a 
# TypeError because a string cannot be added with an integer.


#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)
# The output will come out as true.

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.
stringList = ['notebook', 'pencil', 'eraser']
floatList = [6.14, 4.82, 5.96]

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?
# Camel Case, Pascal Case, and Snake Case 

# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program? 
# A scenario is when you are making a fighting game where a player gets points to win
# and making a system where the scores are compared to determine the winner.

# 14. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a logical operator in a program? 
# A scenario where I'd use a logical operator in a program is when I

# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

print(currentScore < highScore)

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
# The type() function allows the programmer to determine which
# datatype is being used for a function.
